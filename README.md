# Programming by python
Welcome to the "Programming by python" repository! This repository is a collection of python scripts where you can find various examples and exercises to learn and improve your python scripting skills,I will put here some of the things I learn in Python,
This time i will make a discription for my scripts but in the future you will see more scripts on different subjects.
## Description
### script 1: add_2_matrix.py
Description: The code take the value of rows and the value of column then it makes to lists containing the number zero based on the number of rows and columns, The user enter the elements of matries it is the same number of rows and columns and the code swaping the elements of liats with the elements of matries then it add the elements and put it in the "result" list.
### Script 2: binary_decimal.py
Description: This Python script allows users to convert numbers between binary and decimal representations. It prompts the user to choose the desired conversion operation ('binary' or 'decimal'). If the user selects 'decimal', the script prompts them to enter a binary number and converts it to decimal. If 'binary' is chosen, the script prompts for a decimal number and converts it to a 4-digit binary representation. The script handles invalid input gracefully, displaying an error message for undefined operations.
### script 3: encryption.py
Description: This Python script implements a Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. It prompts the user to enter a letter and a key for encryption. The encryption process shifts each letter in the alphabet by the specified key, wrapping around if necessary. The script then provides the encrypted letter. Additionally, the user can choose to decrypt the encrypted letter by entering 'y'. The decryption process reverses the encryption by shifting each letter back by the key. The script handles non-alphabetic characters gracefully, leaving them unchanged during both encryption and decryption.
### Script 4: guess.py
Description: This Python script implements a simple hangman game where the player needs to guess a randomly selected word. The script randomly generates words consisting of lowercase letters, and the player has a limited number of tries to guess the word correctly. The script provides a visual representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses. The player can enter their guesses for letters, and if correct, the corresponding letters in the word are revealed. The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of tries. Upon winning or losing, appropriate messages are displayed.
### Script 5: to_octal.py
Description: This Python script provides functionality for converting numbers between different numeral systems. It prompts the user to choose from four conversion operations: decimal to octal, octal to decimal, octal to binary, and binary to octal. Depending on the selected operation, the script performs the conversion and returns the result. The script handles input validation and ensures correct conversion according to the specified numeral systems. Users can easily convert numbers between octal, decimal, and binary representations using this script.
### Script 6: twoSum.py
Description: This Python script aims to implement the "two sum" problem, where the goal is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target number. However, the implementation is incomplete as of now. The script defines a function `readNums()` to read numbers from the user input, which are expected to be separated by commas. The script initializes an empty array and a target number. Currently, the script only reads numbers from the user input and stores them in the array. The main function `twoSum()` is commented out and not yet implemented. Once completed, the `twoSum()` function is intended to find the indices of the two numbers in the array that add up to the target number and print them. Future updates to this script will include the implementation of the `twoSum()` function to solve the "two sum" problem.
### Folder: pyClass
Description: The "pyClass" folder contains Python code files that serve as learning resources for understanding the fundamentals of classes in Python. Each code file within this folder likely demonstrates various aspects of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, including class definition, instantiation, attributes, methods, inheritance, and more. By exploring the code files in this folder, learners can gain practical experience and deepen their understanding of how to effectively use classes to structure and organize code in Python projects. These exercises are valuable for individuals seeking to enhance their proficiency in Python programming and OOP principles.
## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdulrhmanAnsary/Progtamming-by-python.git
```
## Usage
Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the directory and explore the scripts available. Each script is named descriptively to indicate its purpose or the concept it demonstrates.

To execute a python script, you can use the following command:
```bash
python file_name.py
```
Remember to make the code executable if it's not already:
```bash
chmod +x file_name.py
```
